      <img src="/images/farm.jpg" class="key-image"/>
      Lauren and Colin enjoy a wonderful leisurely lifestyle in scenic Arlington, Virginia with their fluffy cat, Finn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lauren grew up in La Grange, Illinois, with her Mom and Dad, Marichris and Steven, and her younger brother, John. Lauren currently works at the Supreme Court as a curatorial assistant, designing exhibits and managing the archives. She loves museums, running early in the morning, designing and decorating, cooking and eating, and taking care of Colin and Finn. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colin, 25, is originally from Holliston, Massachusetts. His parents are Bob and Cathy. Colin also has three sisters: Errin, Allyson and Olivia. Colin works as a Software Engineer in Washington, DC. He enjoys cooking, reading, embarking on other awesome culinary adventures (like making bacon), and learning and practicing programming languages in order to bend computers to his will. According to Lauren, Colin is a pretty big nerd.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="/images/chickencow.jpg"  class="key-image"/>
      Colin and Lauren met while living across the hall from each other in New Hall dorm while attending George Washington University. 
      It was Lauren's 21st birthday and she had a few friends over celebrating. 
      Colin was having a nice quiet night with his roommates, when he felt the call of fate from across the hall 
      and knocked on Lauren's door. The next few months there were filled with awkward elevator rides, and they 
      did not actually get together until the summer after moving out of New Hall. One day during the summer 
      Colin felt the calling of destiny again, when he felt the desire for a tasty frozen treat. He took a stroll 
      to Lauren's place of business, Cone-E Island Ice Cream Parlor, and when Colin walked in, Lauren hatched a plan
      to get him to call her. While preparing Colin's ice cream treat, Lauren flirted and Colin asked for her number. They got
      together a few days later and the rest is history!
      <br/>
      <br/>
      After almost 5 years of dating Colin proposed to Lauren 2 days before Christmas in 2010!
