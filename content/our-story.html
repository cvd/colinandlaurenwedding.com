      Colin and Lauren met while living across the hall from each other in New Hall dorm while attending George Washington University. It was Lauren’s 21st birthday and she had a few friends over celebrating. Colin was having a nice quiet night with his roommates, when he felt the call of fate from across the hall and knocked on Lauren’s door. The next few months there were filled with awkward elevator rides, and they did not actually get together until the summer after moving out of New Hall. One day during the summer Colin felt the calling of destiny again, when he felt the desire for a tasty frozen treat. He took a stroll to Lauren’s place of business, Cone-E Island Ice Cream Parlor, and when Colin walked in, Lauren hatched a plan to get him to call her. While preparing Colin’s ice cream treat, Lauren flirted and Colin asked for her number. They got together a few days later and the rest is history!

      After almost 5 years of dating Colin proposed to Lauren 2 days before Christmas in 2010!
